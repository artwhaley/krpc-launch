# krpc launch

This project is intended to deliver a fully-fledged, configurable launcher
that uses the excellent kRPC mod in KSP.

kRPC (Kerbal Remote Procedure Call) is a mod that adds a RPC server to KSP.
At this point, you can hook up *any* software to KSP and make it do whatever
you want.

Because the RPC server communicates through HTTP, practically any language
can be used at the client side, as long as there's an adapter written for it.

Not only is Python the "native" language for the kRPC adapter, it also...
Python! Making it my preferred choice of coding in the first place.
